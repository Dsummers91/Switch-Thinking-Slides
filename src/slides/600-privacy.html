    <h2>Privacy</h2>
    <p>Every transaction on blockchain is public<p>
    <p>Everyone can see your entire account history and balance</p>

    <h2>Speed</h2>
    <p>Most blockchains are very slow<p>
    <ul>
      <li>Bitcoin - 10 minute block time</li>
      <li>Ethereum - 14 second block time</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Randomness</h2>
    <p> Blockchains are inherently deterministic.<p>
    <h4>Most contracts may used pseudo-random variables such as blockhash<h4>
        <pre>
          <code>
          bytes32 blockHash = blockhash(block.number - 1);
          uint32 winner = uint32(blockHash) % numOfTickets;
          </code>
        </pre>
        <h4>But miners always have final say<h4>

    <h2>Race Conditions</h2>
    <p>There is an inescapable time delay between the moment a blockchain transaction is broadcast to the network and the moment that that same transaction is mined into a block. During the intervening period, transactions sit in a pending transaction pool (mempool) waiting to be mined.</p>
