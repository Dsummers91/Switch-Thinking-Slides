    The trilemma claims that blockchain systems can only at most have two of the following three properties:

    Decentralization (defined as the system being able to run in a scenario where each participant only has access to O(c) resources, i.e. a regular laptop or small VPS)
    Scalability (defined as being able to process O(n) > O(c) transactions)
    Security (defined as being secure against attackers with up to O(n) resources)
